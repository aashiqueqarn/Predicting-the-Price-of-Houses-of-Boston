# Predicting-the-Price-of-Houses-of-Boston
Here we need to predict the price of houses in Boston Town by the help of Machine Learning, using Python and Linear Regression Algorithm.
The data is given in the file named housing.csv.
The file contains several columns.
The column COUNT means the houses are available or not. If the house is availabel then it is labeled as 1 else 0.
RM means average number of rooms per dwelling.
LSTAT means lower status of Population(percent).
PTRATIO means pupil teacher ratio.
MEDV means median value of owner occupied homes /$1000. And this is our target variable.
Here in this file housing.csv we don't have any false or missing value so we didn't go for data preprocessing.
